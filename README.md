## CGPA-calc
was getting bored so made this project..

Main.cpp is the file which you can compile or you might find exe in debug folder for direct execution
# There are 2 options
1. Input credits(these are saved for future runs)
2. Calculate gpa

When running for the 1st time u will have to enter credits.
(Enter it in order given in Result for easyness)
After this go to calculate gpa.
There select ur respective grades in same order as u entered the credits
You will see the gpa
